	<h3> Introduction </h3>
	<p>
		 Learning the <strong> Second Language </strong> is important as it is essential to every aspect and interaction in our everyday lives. Every sentence we use has the purpose of enabling second language learners to move beyond vocabulary and grammar to the functional aspect of communication. Being able to communicate with each other form bonds, teamwork, and it’s what separates humans from other animal species. Communication drives our lives and better ourselves. 
		 The topics and the exercises of this text aim at enhancement of the learners’ communication skill. Let’s begin with ‘Self-introduction’ as “You only get one chance to create a first and best impression”.
		 The arrival of a new academic year brings a lot of energy and enthusiasm to students, teachers and parents (although in a different way) and it is high time to practise <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank"> Introduction about google </a>. Here, two ways of introducing oneself - in educational atmosphere and for career, are presented for practice as both are indispensable in one’s life.

	<h3>Name section</h3>
	<p>
		Hi! My name is Shiva. I am 19 years old. I live in Sattur with my parents and brothers. I am a first year Computer Science student.  I am pursuing a Certificate Course in Communicative and Functional English after my college hours to improve my language skills. I like Programming and Mathematics. During weekends, I take dancing lessons, swimming and veena. I like puppies. My favorite colour is pink. My favourite food is masala dosa. I want to learn how to play volleyball better. Thank you. 
	</p>
		<h3> confidence and speed </h3>
		<p>
			Thank you.  I hope to talk with you soon (or) I hope to meet you again soon. 
			Self introductions can also be expanded into other activities throughout the year so that this vocabulary is recycled and new vocabulary integrated. Students can talk about: greeting, name, age, where they are from, food, animal, music, hobbies/sports, family, closing with more confidence and speed.  It gives them a chance to reveal how much they can say about themselves at one time.

			<h3> opportunity </h3>
			<p>
				Dress appropriately and be perfectly groomed. These are things over which one can have control, so make the most of them. Since first impressions count,<strong> introduce yourself </strong> with style before you even open your mouth.
				2. Walk into an interview confidently. Avoid slouching, slumping or crossing your body with your arms. You are going to win, so face them with confidence.
				3. Greet your interviewers immediately. Offer your hand for a handshake, make eye contact and smile. 
				4. Open your interview with a comment about being pleased to have the <em> opportunity </em> to be interviewed by the firm or organization. Thank the interviewers for the opportunity. This should be brief, genuine and not flowery.

			<h3> Self-introduction </h3>
			
			<p>

			Self introduction during an interview is a crucial one in any <b> networking situation </b>. It is both a personal and professional communication skill that is needed in your everyday life. Think about how you can use this short period of time to not only introduce yourself but also convey something about who you are and what you do. 
			When you introduce yourself, it is not for anyone else's benefit but YOURS!  In brief, self-introduction is marketing your skills. First impressions count a great deal in an interview. 
			A job interview is a tough <i> competition </i> with one or a few winners. And the manner in which you introduce yourself in an interview will be remembered so much so that it might be the deal breaker. Self introductions are a natural oral form that help to assess the workers’ confidence, vocabulary, grammar and attitude, and also help the employers  get to know them. Here are  some tips for introducing yourself. <br>
